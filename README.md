# HTML-AND-CSS

Welcome, this repository is about how i learned html and css.
I read this book about html and css, and each day i would do one chapter of it.
After i finished the chapter i would go on my computer and and do what I learned from the chapter and upload it to github. 
I hope you enjoy this repository.
